      <description>Introduction Heap memory, also known simply as the &amp;ldquo;heap&amp;rdquo;, is a critical region of a computer&amp;rsquo;s memory that provides dynamic memory allocation. This is particularly useful when creating complex data structures, such as linked lists or hashmaps, as it is often not possible to determine the sizes of these structures at compile time.
Program Execution When a program is compiled, the resulting binary file typically consists of several sections that serve different purposes.</description>

      <title>Virtual Memory: An Overview</title>

      <description>Introduction Virtual memory is a feature of an operating system that provides an application the impression that it has contiguous working memory (an unbroken block), while in fact it is physically fragmented and may even overflow onto disk storage. Systems that use this method make programming of large applications easier and use real physical memory (RAM) more efficiently than if the physical memory was only divided into several fixed partitions.</description>
